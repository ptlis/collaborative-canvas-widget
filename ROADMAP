Roadmap:
========

Supported Features:
===================

* Drag-and-drop interface for placing cards onto a canvas.
* Card removal.
* Support for any number of time periods
* Support for the following decks:
    * Hybrid Learning Model Cards.
    * Viewpoints Workshop Assessment Cards.
    * ViewPoints Workshop Information Skills Cards.
    * Internally-created learning design cards.
    * Sticky note cards with selectable colours.
    * Media cards (embed youtube vidieos, vimeo videos, images & iTEC widgets)
* The user may seleect a subset of possible decks to use for the session.
    * This selection may be changed at any time
* Connecting Lines can be drawn between cards.
    * Uses drag & drop interface for creation & removal.
    * Dynamic line drawing means the user know what the connecting line will look like when the action completes.
* Local persistence (the current browser) of card data.
* Can be packaged as a w3 widget and hosted on a wookie server and embedded in moodle.
* Collaborative use of the application, the tool can be deployed and used for real-time collaborative editing of cards (eg. from within moodle):
    * Using the Wave API offered by the wookie server.
    * Using the ROLE API offered by the ROLE server (sandbox @ http://role-sandbox.eu/ ).
* Dynamic horizontal scaling of card positions making the widget usable for almost any combination of screen resolution.
* Canvas zoom out for 'birds eye view'
* Cut / Copy / Paste cards placed on the canvas.
* Support for tablets such as the iPad.
* Import & Export capability to allow transfer of canvas data.


Work In Progress:
=================

* Card customisation
    * In-application Card and deck creation / customization: much of the  code  is ready to support this feature, the difficult part is UI design.
    * In cards edit view the 'activity' should be customisable; replace with eg description, title etc...


TODO List:
==========

* Improvements to first-run
    * First page options:
        * Import Existing workspace.
        * Select preset (eg Ulster Viewpoints Workshop)
        * Customised canvas options
   * On first one display a (skippable) 'landing screen' with a 3-4 page quick tour, to get across:
        a. you can use cards as you wish
        b. you don’t have to use all the principles, but each as often as wanted
        c. there’s no ‘right’ answer.
    * Hint tooltips:
        * On left bar, have an arrow pointing right with 'drag' text...
* canvasStorage needs remMulti function (Required for wookie to prevent overloading server with rapid requests)
    * Use for canvasStorage.list.removeAll()
    * Use for connections.model.removeForCard()
    * Use for cards on containers.model.remove()
* Serious testing on wookie / wave!
* Initialise function should fire create events?
    * won't work, because cards depends on decks?
    * if this is so, can probably remove this dependency.
* Connection edit dismiss takes a *long* time - due to events?.
* Add entry for mind-mapping to Explore card in HLM deck.
* Reduce card sizes by 75%
* Lighten time-period background color?
* Cards should automatically resize vertically to display all entered content.
* Sticky notes should have the ability to be resized
    * width needs to use % of canvas
    * Height need something fancy - ideally it should scale nicely if a new time period is added etc, this might mean anchoring edges via % height of the container the top / bottom edge is in.
    * Need to update stored x & y coordinate of centerpoint as well as new width/height.
* Temporary holding area for cards to keep (that have been filled out) but are not currently required.
* Mechanism to indicate that activities take place across several time periods?
* Deck selection requires the ability to re-order items in a list.


Bug List
========

* Import & Export broken on ROLE
* Adding items to prompt template cards doesn't correctly save.
* Context menus can fall off the bottom (and maybe side) of the screen.
* Connection rendering problems (on copy or over time periods?)
* Rendering bug in inputs in selection cards (needs to be wider..).
* When cards are the smallest size hide the menu button & only display on card hover-over.
* Connections break when you delete a time period.
* Inputs on template cards do not display correctly on ROLE.
* ROLE desync handling...
* (On ROLE / chrome?) Text entered into template cards has scroll-bar
* Youtube / Vimeo cards:
    * Sometimes card loses video URL - possibly related to connections?
* Updates don't work on localStorage?
* z-indexes don't work on localStorage
* When creating a connection the green path that indicates a new connection is behind the background.
* Resize containers after delete.


Next Features:
==============

* Abilitity to select & move several cards at once.
    * Perhaps a drag to select an area & grab all cards within?
* 'Organise'/'Birds-eye View' Button - toogles between maximum & minimum zoom levvels.
* Method of indictating priority?
* Connections
    * Add directional arrow capabilities
* Performance enhancements
    * add selector context when looking up elements with jquery (time consuming!!!)
    * Card drag performance on firefox is appaling (may be only with connections)!!
* Contextual card information (eg starring, '!' for high priority)
* Support for flickr
* Sharing of customised card decks.


Future features (time-permitting):
==================================

* Flow chart deck?
* Mind-mapping deck?
* Search feature?
* Customisation of time-period background (images, HTML5 canvas element for dynamic backdrops such as time-scales)
* Creation of backdrops; titled frames, graphics.
* Scalable / resizeable cards: user-testing suggests that this dimension can be used to indicate the importance of a card relative to others, indicate the duration of an activity etc.; by being non-prescriptive the hope is that we can support as many different uses as possible
* Better print support: transform the data in the cards in a way that allows the results of a planning session to be printed in a more appropriate layout. (it is simple to display the cards in a format suitable for print - the difficulty part of this feature determining   card order due the canvas allowing card placement in any configuration)


TESTING Process:
----------------
Actions to test to make sure no regressions have slipped in:
    * importing & exporting
    * Connections
        * Create new
            * With label
